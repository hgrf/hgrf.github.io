## Racine

<p style="text-align:justify;">

<a href="https://hgrf.github.io/racine">Racine</a> is a tool that enables researchers to keep track of their samples. It runs on a central server in the local network of your research institute and can be accessed using a web browser. Features include file import from Samba servers, sharing samples while protecting individual users' notes, LaTeX typesetting and many more. I started working on Racine during my research work in the Physics Laboratory at Ecole Normale Supérieure. Today, it is used in laboratories in Germany, France and Switzerland.

## El Poisson

<a href="https://github.com/hgrf/el-poisson-billy">El Poisson</a> is yet another hacked Big Mouth Billy Bass. It was a little contribution to <a href="https://linktr.ee/mooreamusic">Moorea</a>'s 2023 music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZalNH8_v24">"Un effort"</a>. This particular hack features a Bluetooth audio sink and motor control via bluetooth. The python GUI is easy to use and can even connect to Ableton via a virtual MIDI interface, so that the fish's movements can be programmed as a MIDI track.
